# Arcanist
A class mod that aims to implement a variant specialist Wizard class for Baldur's Gate 3. It is provided as a completely separate class and thus should be compatible to other mods that may amend Wizards or Sorcerers.

## Description
Arcanists are wizards born with innate magical abilities, gaining the ability to use Metamagic. This characteristic comes with both advantages and disadvantages for the class.

## Advantages
Arcanists are Wizards and thus, can learn spells from scrolls and gain proficiencies accordingly. Their spellcasting attribute is Intelligence.

However, due to their innate ability to manipulate magic, Arcanists also obtain Sorcery points and can exchange one of their spells to another spell on level up. As they reach higher levels they may gain select Metamagic feats.

## Disadvantages
It takes practice and time to master magic. Arcanists divide their attention between innate and scholarly studies. This leaves Arcanists with less time to master new spells. They learn a modest number spells as they level up, gaining only 2 at first level. On each subsequent level Arcanists only learn a single new spell, similar to base class Sorcerers. However, unlike Sorcerer subclasses, Arcanists don't gain any background spells. Unless they invest time and money in learning new spells from scrolls, this could leave them with less spells than most Sorcerers.

Arcanists manipulate magic differently than base class Wizards. They can turn Sorcery points into Spell Slots or vice versa but never master Arcane Recovery.

Compared to Sorcerers Arcanists don't have access to feats that make Draconic or Wild Sorcerers appealing, such as Draconic Resilience or Tides of Chaos. Their spell casting ability is Intelligence and thus are unlikely to excel in Charisma based skills, unlike Sorcerers.
